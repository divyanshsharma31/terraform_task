# 🐳 Terraform Docker Project

This project demonstrates how to use Terraform with the Docker provider to provision containers automatically.

## 📦 What It Does

- Initializes Terraform with the Docker provider
- Creates a container (e.g., Nginx or custom image)
- Destroys it cleanly after use

## 🧾 How to Run

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
